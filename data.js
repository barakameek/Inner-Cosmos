        name: "Attraction Focus: The Spark Plug",
        coreQuestion: "Seriously, who or what flips *your* switch?",
        coreConcept: "Think of this as your personal 'Desire Compass'. What actually *points* you towards sexy feelings? It's more than just gender – it could be someone's vibe, a specific situation, a shared brainwave, or even cool objects or ideas.",
        elaboration: "Yeah, it covers the usual suspects (straight, gay, bi, pan), but also the whole amazing Asexuality spectrum (where attraction might be low-key or absent) and Demisexuality (needing that deep connection first). Plus, maybe you're drawn to brainiacs (hello, Sapiosexuals!), certain power vibes, specific looks, or even super specific things like latex or scenarios (sometimes called fetishes – we explore 'em all judgment-free here!).",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Your Spark Plug might run cool! Strong Asexual vibes here – maybe attraction isn't really your jam, or it pops up rarely and isn't tied to specific things. Totally cool!",
            "Low": "Less about specific targets, more about the *feeling*. Maybe you need that deep Demisexual bond first, or your desire tends to respond rather than initiate. Your spark is selective!",
            "Moderate": "A pretty common setting! You might vibe with familiar things like gender or style, be open to lots of people (Pan-leaning maybe?), or need *some* connection but not necessarily a soul-bond first.",
            "High": "Ooh, a strong pull! You likely have specific types, dynamics (brains? power?), or even certain objects/materials/situations that really get your engine going. Hello, focused desire!",
            "Very High": "Laser focus! Your attraction might be super specific to a narrow group, OR certain objects, materials, vibes, or scenarios are absolute *must-haves* to light your fire. This is where strong fetishes live!"
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Asexuality, Demisexuality, Straight, Gay, Bi, Pan, Brainiac-lovers (Sapiosexuals), Fetishes (latex, feet, uniforms – you name it!), digging certain body types, getting turned on by D/s roles.",
        personaConnection: "Defines the 'who' or 'what' gets your attention."
    },
    "Interaction": { // REVISED: Focus on Leaning (D/s/W)
        name: "Interaction Leaning: The Role Compass",
        coreQuestion: "On the spectrum of control, where do you typically find yourself pointing: Dominant, Submissive, or Switch?",
        coreConcept: "This element now specifically maps your *leaning* within power dynamics. Are you drawn to taking charge (Dominant), yielding control (Submissive), or fluidly moving between both (Switch)?",
        elaboration: "This isn't about intensity (that's RoleFocus!), but about your preferred *direction*. High scores indicate a Dominant leaning, low scores a Submissive leaning, and scores near the middle suggest a Switch or versatile inclination. It incorporates styles like Top/Bottom where applicable.",
        scoreInterpretations: { // REVISED Interpretations
            "Very Low": "Strong pull towards yielding control, following direction, and embracing submissive roles. (Strong Submissive Leaning)",
            "Low": "Comfortable letting others lead, preferring receptive or bottoming roles. (Moderate Submissive Leaning)",
            "Moderate": "Enjoys flexibility! Comfortable with both leading and following, likely identifying as a Switch or Versatile. (Switch/Versatile Leaning)",
            "High": "Enjoys taking initiative, guiding the flow, and embodying leading or topping roles. (Moderate Dominant Leaning)",
            "Very High": "Strong pull towards taking charge, setting the scene, and embodying Dominant roles. (Strong Dominant Leaning)"
        },
        examples: "D/s roles (Dom/Sub/Switch), Top/Bottom/Versatile roles, aspects of Caregiver/Little dynamics related to guidance/dependence.",
        personaConnection: "Defines your directional leaning within power dynamics (Leading vs. Following vs. Switching)."
    },
    "Sensory": { // No change to definition text
        name: "Sensory Emphasis: The Feeling Finder",
        coreQuestion: "What physical sensations make you go 'Ooh!' or 'Aah!'?",
        coreConcept: "This is all about how much *physical feeling* matters to you – the type, the intensity, the whole shebang. Touch, temperature, textures, pressure, even sights, sounds, and smells!",
        elaboration: "Covers everything your senses pick up! Light touches, firm grips, maybe even a little impact? Hot wax, cool ice? Smooth silk, rough rope? Tight squeezes, gentle vibrations? Plus, how sights, sounds, or smells play into it. It also includes the whole spectrum from pure pleasure to playing with pain or intensity (like in BDSM).",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Feelings are meh? Physical stuff might be way less important than the emotional vibe or the mental game for you. Intense sensations are probably a 'no thanks'.",
            "Low": "Gentle does it! You likely prefer soft, warm, affectionate, or 'vanilla' sensations. Comfort is key, intense stuff is usually off the table.",
            "Moderate": "You enjoy the classics! A good range of pleasant physical feelings is nice. Maybe you're curious about *mild* intensity (a light spank?), but it's not the main event.",
            "High": "Sensation Seeker! You actively look for specific, strong, or unique physical feelings. Think impact play, temperature games, specific textures (latex!), light bondage, or really zoning in on pleasure spots.",
            "Very High": "INTENSITY NOW! You might *need* strong, specific, or even extreme sensations. Heavy BDSM play (impact, needles, wax - handled safely!), tight bondage, sensory overload/deprivation, or a powerful focus on *very* specific triggers could be your jam."
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Gentle massage, deep kisses, cuddles, BDSM impact (flogging, caning), wax play, ice cubes, rope bondage (Shibari!), blindfolds, e-stim toys, loving the feel of specific fabrics.",
        personaConnection: "Defines how your body likes to experience pleasure (or interesting intensity!)."
    },
    "Psychological": { // Minor wording adjustments possible for role context
        name: "Psychological Driver: The Heart's Quest",
        coreQuestion: "Beyond the physical, *why* sex? What deep-down need does it scratch?",
        coreConcept: "This digs into the core reasons *behind* the sexy times. What emotional, mental, or even soul-level needs does it help you meet or express?",
        elaboration: "It's about the deeper 'why'. Is it about connection (intimacy, trust, vulnerability)? Power (control, surrender)? Self-expression (creativity, validation)? Changing your state (escape, catharsis, stress relief)? Or finding comfort and security? (Note: The *importance* of power dynamics is now captured by RoleFocus).", // Added note
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Maybe sex is mostly about physical release or just plain fun for you? Deeper psychological itches might get scratched elsewhere.",
            "Low": "The emotional side is nice, but maybe not the main focus. Fun, stress relief, or light connection could be the usual drivers.",
            "Moderate": "A healthy mix! Sex probably ticks several boxes – connection, stress relief, fun, feeling good about yourself – alongside the physical enjoyment.",
            "High": "Sex is a key channel for meeting specific, important inner needs. You might consciously seek out intimacy, validation, emotional release, or the psychological aspects of power exchange through it.", // Added power context
            "Very High": "Hitting that deep psychological spot is *the point*. If core needs like deep vulnerability, cathartic release, or specific power-exchange headspaces aren't met, the experience might feel hollow." // Added power context
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Using sex mainly to de-stress (Low/Moderate), building deep emotional bonds through intimacy (High), exploring power dynamics for psychological release (High/Very High), needing to feel desired/validated (High), chasing intense 'subspace' or 'topspace' feelings (Very High).",
        personaConnection: "Defines the emotional 'why' behind your sexual expression."
    },
    "Cognitive": { // Minor wording adjustments possible for role context
        name: "Cognitive Engagement: The Mind Palace",
        coreQuestion: "How much headspace does sex take up? Is it all about fantasy, scenarios, and brainpower?",
        coreConcept: "This measures how much your *mind* gets involved. Are you all about being present in the moment, or do fantasies, stories, psychological games, or witty banter fuel your fire?",
        elaboration: "Includes everything from being totally zoned into physical sensations to having elaborate fantasy worlds, playing out detailed roles, loving mind games, or getting turned on by clever talk or the *idea* of a dynamic. (Note: High scores here combined with high RoleFocus might indicate enjoyment of complex protocols or psychological power play).", // Added note
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Headspace clear! You prefer being fully present and feeling things physically and emotionally. Complex fantasies or analyzing things might just pull you out of the moment.",
            "Low": "Mostly here and now! You enjoy the immediate sensations. Maybe a light scenario pops into your head, but you're not relying on a big internal movie.",
            "Moderate": "Mind + Body synergy! You can enjoy being present, but also appreciate some mental spice – maybe occasional role-play, dirty talk that paints a picture, or getting into the psychology of it.",
            "High": "Your brain is a major erogenous zone! Detailed fantasies, specific role-play scenarios, playing with power dynamics mentally, or sharp, sexy banter really amps things up for you.",
            "Very High": "Welcome to the Mind Palace! Your arousal might *depend* on intricate scenarios, complex fantasy worlds, intense psychological play (mind games!), or the sheer *concept* of what's happening. The story in your head is key."
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Mindful, connected touch (Low), loving descriptive dirty talk (Moderate), detailed D/s scenes with rules/protocol (High/Very High), fantasy LARP-style encounters (High/Very High), getting off on writing/reading complex erotica (High/Very High), intense psychological manipulation play (Very High).",
        personaConnection: "Defines how much your thoughts and imagination get in on the action."
    },
    "Relational": { // No change to definition text
        name: "Relational Context: The Constellation",
        coreQuestion: "What's your ideal setup? Who do you connect with, and how?",
        coreConcept: "This describes your preferred 'social map' for sex and relationships. How many partners? How much commitment? Strangers or soulmates? One-on-one or group hangs?",
        elaboration: "Covers the whole range: flying solo, traditional monogamy, different flavors of ethical non-monogamy (like polyamory or open relationships), group fun, and everything in between. It's about the structure you thrive in.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Solo voyages or a 'just us two' liftoff! You likely prefer masturbation or a deeply bonded, exclusive partnership. Multiple partners or casual stuff might not appeal.",
            "Low": "Team Monogamy! You generally prefer committed, one-on-one relationships as the main stage for your sexuality. Casual encounters might be rare or less fulfilling.",
            "Moderate": "Flexible connections! Maybe you're comfy in a duo but open to possibilities (like swinging sometimes, or dating around before settling down), or value deep bonds without needing strict lifelong exclusivity. Exploring non-monogamy or happy being Solo Poly?",
            "High": "More the merrier (consensually)! You prefer or practice structures involving multiple partners, like Open Relationships or various forms of Polyamory. Communication about connections is key.",
            "Very High": "Charting your own course! You might lean towards Relationship Anarchy (no set rules!), embrace non-hierarchical Polyamory, enjoy group dynamics, or feel comfortable with different levels of commitment and connection across various partners. 'One size fits all' doesn't work for you."
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Masturbation, Serial Monogamy, Lifelong Monogamy, Friends With Benefits, Open Relationships, Swinging, Triads/Quads, Hierarchical Polyamory, Egalitarian Polyamory, Solo Polyamory, Relationship Anarchy, Group Sex, Anonymous hookups.",
        personaConnection: "Defines your ideal 'relationship constellation' (or lack thereof!)."
    },
    "RoleFocus": { // --- NEW 7th ELEMENT ---
        name: "Role Focus: The Intensity Dial",
        coreQuestion: "How important are defined roles and power dynamics (Dom/Sub/Switch) to your intimate satisfaction?",
        coreConcept: "This measures the *intensity* or *salience* of power dynamics and role-play in your intimate life. How central is the D/s/W aspect compared to other factors like pure sensation or emotional connection?",
        elaboration: "A low score suggests roles/dynamics are less important or you prefer egalitarian connection. Moderate scores indicate enjoyment or significance, while high scores suggest roles/dynamics are a primary driver or essential component for fulfilling intimacy. This works alongside the 'Interaction Leaning' element.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Roles? Meh. Power dynamics aren't really your focus. You likely prefer egalitarian connections where power is balanced or not a conscious factor.",
            "Low": "Light touch. Roles might add a bit of spice occasionally, but they aren't necessary for satisfaction. Comfort and connection likely come first.",
            "Moderate": "Engaged. You find defined roles or power dynamics interesting and often incorporate them into play. They add a significant layer to the experience.",
            "High": "Central Pillar. Playing a specific role (D/s/W) or engaging in clear power exchange is a key component of what makes intimacy satisfying and meaningful for you.",
            "Very High": "Essential Core. Defined roles and power dynamics are *the* point. Without this structure or intensity, intimacy might feel incomplete, confusing, or unfulfilling."
        },
        examples: "Preferring strictly vanilla, equal partnerships (Low). Enjoying occasional D/s scenes but not needing them (Moderate). Feeling most authentic when fully embodying a Dom/Sub/Switch role (High). Requiring a 24/7 TPE dynamic for fulfillment (Very High).",
        personaConnection: "Defines the *importance* and *intensity* of power dynamics and roles in your expression."
